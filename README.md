# Chifir #

Chifir is a fun afternoon hack, an implementation of a virtual computer in Rust.

## Technology ##

Chifir is based on the description of the virtual computer in Long Tien
Nguyen and Alan Kay's paper, ["The Cuneiform Tablets of 2015"][tr-2015-004].

Chifir requires a terminal with support for [Sixel][] graphics. [mlterm][] is a
good choice.
